## Overview
This solution focuses on using CSS Grid in making this testimonial template layout, other CSS tools were used as well to try to achieve a layout that's very similar to the original design.   

### The challenge
- The challenge this time was to create a testimonial grid section of a web page based on the design provided in the folders for both mobile(375) and desktop.
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Built with

### What I learned
This challenge has helped me in learning CSS although not to perfection yet but i can now do tasks with it and i believe going forward it will become easier, hopefully.
